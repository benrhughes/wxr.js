##WXR node.js module

This module creates files in the Wordpress eXtended Rss format (WXR). Site and Post exporting are currently (mostly) working, the rest is being worked on. It is still under heavy development so use with caution.

See demo_wxr.js for an example of what the API may look like when it's done.
